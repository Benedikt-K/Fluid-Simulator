Implementation of an IISPH fluid solver for my Bachelorthesis. Visualisation using SFML. Everything in the "SFML data" folder is not my work, but is needed in order to compile it properly. 
To be able to compare the pressure solvers performance, an SPH algorithm using a state equation is also implemented.
IISPH implementation based on notes of Prof. Teschner and the paper "Implicit Incompressible SPH" by Ihmsen et. al. found here: "https://cg.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/publications/2013_TVCG_IISPH.pdf".

The code is not yet user-friendly and needs further work
